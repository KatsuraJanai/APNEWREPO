1. import package java.sql
2. load and register driver. since we are using mysql the driver is: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver//NOT NEEDED ANYMORE
3. create connection --> Connection
4. create a statement --> Statement
5. execute the query
6. process the results
7. close


Other Tips
url should be in form of: "jdbc:mysql://localhost1111/databasename"
"To register driver use Class.forName(). Class.forName(com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)" Loading class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'. This is deprecated. The new driver class is `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'. The driver is automatically registered via the SPI and manual loading of the driver class is generally UNNECESSARY.

Getting connectiong String or declaring connection. Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password);
Statement should be declared like: Statement stmt = con.createStatement()
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(String query)
rs.next() to move cursor from table heading
To get data from ResultSet use rs.GetInt(Column in database 1st or 2nd column etc) GetString("Name of column in database") etc
